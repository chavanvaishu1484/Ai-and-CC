# Observations
We created a box plot of variables 'age & 'sex' & used survival as the hue
Ther we visualized three variables Age, Sex & Survival. Two out of these are categorical and one is numerical
Now in addition to the information about the age of each gender, you can also see the distribution of passengers who survived
For instance, we can see that among the male passengers, on average more younger people survived as compared to older ones
Also, we can see that among the survived passangers, more female survived as complared to male.
